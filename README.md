# Airborne <br> A Game about Kicking your way to victory!

</div>

This is a project I started to learn about CI/CD in Unity, and it's also open source, so feel free to use it to learn! All art assets were also made by me with [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), a tool I very much recommend for anyone doing pixel art.

The CI/CD implementation I'm using is based on [this article](https://davidmfinol.medium.com/ci-cd-with-unity-github-actions-and-fastlane-e7aaa337784) by David Finol, from Medium, and uses [Game CI](https://game.ci/).
